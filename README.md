- ### **Design**  

  - **Color Scheme**  
    - There are three main colors that are used in this game and they are Orange, Lavender and Turquoise.  

  - **Typography**  
    - In this project we have been using the Indie Flower font as our main font on the entire site aswell as
    Sans Serif as the back-up font if anything were to happen that would make the site unable to use the main
    font. Indie Flower was picked because it looked playful which matched the websites general feel.  

  - **Imagery**  
    - The website doesn't really use many pictures or images but icons were used in the header and game buttons
    to give it a feeling of simplicity. The rules are also shown as a picture to keep reading to a minimum
    for maximum relaxation.  

## **The Different Areas**  

---

### **The Header**  
![Header](/assets/images/Header.PNG "Play Game!")

It doesn't really serve a function more than to get you in the mood and make the page look a bit more fun!

### **Rusult Board**

### **Game Buttons**

This it where the player interacts with the game. The player picks one of the options and the 
computer responds with a move of ite own.

  or look at the rules. Quick, easy and simple.

      - Just enter the site and press one of the buttons and you are good to go.

     just close the site and move on.

    or if its all just down to chance.
